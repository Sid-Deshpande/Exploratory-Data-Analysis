## Welcome to Airbnb Booking Analysis!

Airbnb Booking Analysis is a Python-based project focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb booking data using Google Colab. This project aims to analyze and visualize Airbnb booking data to uncover insights into booking patterns, pricing trends, popular destinations, and other key metrics. By leveraging Python and Google Colab for data analysis and visualization, this project offers an accessible and interactive platform for exploring Airbnb booking data.

### Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Dive deep into Airbnb booking data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for comprehensive data analysis and visualization.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore interactive visualizations of booking trends, occupancy rates, pricing variations, and more using Google Colab notebooks.
- **Insightful Reports**: Generate insightful reports and summaries of key findings from the EDA process to provide valuable insights for Airbnb hosts and travelers.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Perform data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to ensure the quality and integrity of the Airbnb booking data before analysis.

### Getting Started

To get started with Airbnb Booking Analysis, simply follow these steps:

1. **Open Google Colab Notebook**: Open the provided Google Colab notebook containing the Python code for EDA of Airbnb booking data.
